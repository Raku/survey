I'm encouraged by some progress made in packaging.  I've followed some Debian-related discussions on GitHub: being able to apt-get a new-ish version of Rakudo is crucial to widespread adoption, I believe, and it's coming along.  The nxadm packages have filled the gap in the meantime, and it's easy to similarly install in macOS via Homebrew (and I imagine it's not bad at all in Windows, with the official *.msi and Chocolatey package).

I just sincerely love the Perl community and I geniuinely believe that Perl 6 will be very successful in the long run.  The design is elegant, the language is -Ofun, and the ethos are right on."

It's a tough sell on the job (company uses Java, Javascript, some R) and I haven't really taken on any significant side-projects recently. I like to keep up-to-date on Rakudo/Perl 6 developments though.

For me, Perl 6 offers a great mix of brevity and readability; not too line-noisey, not too verbose. The gradual-typing and multi-dispatch is great too. All of this comes together to make a language that is really fun to use, moreso than any other language I know.

It just needs its killer-app that addresses some real pain point in other languages to make the industry stand up and take notice. No insight into what that is though."
