Some comments on the docs:
- Many of them seem to be written for people coming from Perl and are light on the details for Perl-y concepts.
- There are explanations of _how_ language features work, but not _why_ they are designed that way and how they might be used. This is even more important for things that you find only in Perl and Raku. (E.g. sigils and containers. It took me at least a month to go from ""What is this Rube Goldberg contraption doing in my language?"" to ""This is actually really useful if you use it intelligently."".)
- An article on how to work in the ecosystem, project structure, use of the tools, how to write documentation, ... would be very useful. (Reference: https://wiki.haskell.org/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program)"

- Fast: I was not able to find any performance numbers but looks like it's similar to Python in terms of performance. I need a much better performance to use Raku as my to-go language. 
- Ability to compile to binary: Something similar to how Go compiles code.
- Good linear algebra, Good plotting library: This is a must for me. Wouldn't it be great if we had something similar to Pytorch and D3js, written in as much Raku as possible? (And, then blog about it using Raku static site generator)
- Good documentation: Documentation is very poor, confusing, and convoluted on Raku.org. I use https://raku.guide/. I wish the official documentation could be this good, with more examples from Raku experts. Also, need a tutorial on How to structure a project, how to build, publish, and maintain a project/module.
- Syntax similar to math: Few things are odd to me for example ""**"" instead of ""^"" for power. I wish the syntax was similar to how we read mathematics.
- Forums: The community should also use forums like Reddit more often. It makes searching answers easier than IRC channels. Not everyone knows how to best use IRC channels or wait for someone to reply to a question that may have been asked multiple times already. I think this will prove to be a great help in marketing Raku."

There are amazing people in the Raku community, sadly the reputation is damaged by the rename fiasco, perl7 hate.

The language needs to catchup in terms of developer ergonomics. Larry et al desogned a wonderful language but the tooling needs to be better... and vitally some of the community are toxic to the future ofnthe language despite their amazing conteibutions. 

The rename was damaging and the perceived attitude towards Perl7 also.

The we don't want to be Perl anymore because Perl is dead, but we need everything Perl to mention Raku attitude. Then the wait Perl7, you can't do that!!

It's left a bad taste in my mouth, I don't want to be part of the pettiness. And Raku is niche, so is Perl. So I can choose easily to not do Perl or Raku.
Perl has legacy, so has value where as Raku does not. We need people to adopt Raku, but with the current dramas and personalities I don't know how to justify anyone investing energy into it."

REST API clients/servers, cro tricks, DB persistence, NativeCall deep dive & reference, Concurrency/Async examples for real world, MOP approaches, etc.).  I can infer with the best of them, and examples really help.  Perl 6 Fundamentals raised my game very quickly, due to the examples.  If I am to become more effective, it would really help to have actual developers (like Moritz) show how to apply Raku by example with concise discussion.  I leap ahead when I get hold of that kind of material.  More of the same will cause growth in Raku -- just like when O'Reilly published so many of the Perl books.  Advanced Perl Programming enabled me to write IBM's (Tivoli's) log adapter for the 2000 Olympic games -- the mechanics were right in front of me and I used them in the real world quite successfully.  BTW, as the blogs roll out I am picking up a lot of useful tools for my toolbox.  But it would be ideal if there was a major trend toward intermediate & advanced ""literature"" from the superstar Raku developers.  I predict that it would cause a tidal wave of adoption for the language.  The language is already fantastic.  I'll keep plodding along with my learning, but it would help a lot to have a digital bookshelf of Raku literature similar to my old shelf of O'Reilly Perl paperback books."
